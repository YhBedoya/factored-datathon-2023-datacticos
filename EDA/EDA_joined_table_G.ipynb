I needed a good controller for Grand Theft Auto 3 because playing on the keyboard was taking all the fun out of it.\\nAfter comparison shopping at local electronics stores, I found that the Sidewinder was one of the best controllers around for these reasons:\\n- Sturdy and solid. Won\\'t break when you twist it and turn it.\\n- Very comfortable to hold because of its rounded design and light weight.\\n- Easy to setup. As soon as I plugged the USB into my computer, Windows automatically recognized it without any problems or need to install any drivers.\\n- Many games support it right off the bat. The \"joystick\" option appeared in all of the games that I have on the PC - GTA3, Wolfenstein, IL-2 Shturmovik, etc.\\n- The buttons are well placed and easy to differentiate, you won\\'t confuse \"shoot\" with \"jump\" while playing.\\nI\\'ve been using it for over 6 months now, it hasn\\'t broken, cracked or malfunctioned yet, despite all the abuse and spilled drinks I\\'ve put it trough.

Then the USB version was released (exactly the same only USB and no daisy-chain possibility), but now once again it seems to have been taken off the market, as it is extremely difficult to find it anywhere (for some help with this, go directly to Microsoft).

       " \"I've had my Sidewinder USB Gamepad for 8 years, and without a doubt it is the most durable, efficient, and reliable gamepad I have ever seen.  Having grown up playing mostly console games I find using the gamepad for PC games has a much more natural feel than using a keyboard and mouse.  It has lasted through nearly 1500 hours of gameplay over the past 8 years and has only started to show its age in the last few weeks.  I've heard that Microsoft will begin relaunching the Sidewinder line and I can only hope that the USB Gamepad will be in the line-up.\",\n",
       " \"I've had this pad for a few years already.  I have never had a problem with any of the buttons not working or wearing out.  For $15 it's very durable.  I have tried other pads and none of them are as good as, in my opinion, this one.  It is very comfortable in your hands, and you just plug it in and play.  With some other pads the USB would fall out with just a tap, but with the SideWinder the USB stays in until you pull it out.  I only have two complaints.  First the top three buttons are smaller than the bottom three, so i accidentally pushed the wrong button sometimes.  Also, as is common with gamepads, the D-pad is round, so the directions aren't always precise.  Sometimes I'ld be playing Street Fighter or a fighting game and I'ld push down to duck, but it would read me pushing down and forward and i'ld take a hit.  It's still one of the best gamepads out there that i have tried.  If you can find it at a Wal-Mart it sells for about $15.  That's cheaper than most, and it's a good deal.\",\n",
       " 'This controller works perfectly to my experience. The drivers for it are already on most computers going back to windows 98, so you literally can just plug-in and play! This conroller is shaped-well with very well-placed triggers. The button layout is a bit large but one can get used to it; for 2-D games I cannot imagine a better controller.',\n",
       " 'nothing better for tight,precise control of lara croft.i have 4 of them all excellent for 3rd person games.my highest recommendation.my recommendation is only for this model.the 4 button on right side are junk,no matter who makes em.',\n",
       " 'The controls are very touchy but with some time and practice it will be good',\n",
       " \"I bought this controller at a wal mart about a year back (roughly) And it's been pretty good for the $15 I paid for it. Now that it's showing its age, the down button doesn't work so well, but I didn't expect it to last forever. Worth $15, but not much more.\",\n",
       " 'Don\\'t take the \"5 stars rating\" reviews in such consideration, because their owners don\\'t seem to play many diferent type of games. It\\'s directional pad is a COMPLETE JUNK. If you have emulators on your computer, like M.A.M.E, and usually play fighting games (Street Fighter, KOF etc...), FORGET it.\\nIt is also NOT recommended to play any other emulator games. PC games are also a hard task to do.\\nWhy?\\nSimply because the D-pad doesn\\'t work. It\\'s almost IMPOSSIBLE to make the moves work well.\\nThe one star I gave goes to all the rest (I mean the buttons and the design).\\nStay away from any gamepad from MS. They are the worst choice.',\n",
       " \"Like other reviewers I started with a Logitech Rumblepad and had no end of problems trying to configure it for different games, then half the time my PC couldn't find it on startup. I must have installed the drivers about a dozen times (they seemed to disappear off my system) before it went back to the store. I then came home with the MS Sidewinder, plugged it in...and I was off and running. The easiest installation possible, and no problems so far.\\nI would have given it five stars, but it is a little lightweight and feels a bit flimsy, but other than that, it has been a joy compared to the Logitech.\"]"
