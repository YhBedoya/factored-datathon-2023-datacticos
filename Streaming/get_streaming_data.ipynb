These ride and crash beautifully, and work well live or in the studio.\\\\n\\\\nAlthough I have owned and played just about every hi-hat model in Zildjian\\'s modern lines these stand out because they are versatile enough to work with rock (mic\\'d of course) or acoustic piano trio - and anything in between.\",\"reviewerID\":\"A2NYK9KWFMJV4Y\",\"reviewerName\":\"Mike Tarrani\",\"style\":\"{\\\\\"Size:\\\\\":\\\\\" 14\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\"}\",\"summary\":\"Excellent for lower volume music and more\",\"verified\":\"false\",\"vote\":\"10\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140016909}']\n",

So I ordered\\\\nthe Planet Waves Ebony Bridge Pin set with End Pin. What arrived was a totally different package than expected\\\\nand with one less bridge pin. Nice box though.\\\\n\\\\nThe reason I am not too concerned about it, or complained about it, is that I only paid $11.00, shipped, for the set. The\\\\nlowest cost I could find on the net, including Amazon, is $16.00 for the Planet Waves 7 pin plus End pin set encased\\\\nin a typical plastic blister pack. I received a pretty good deal in the end. I can go without an extra bridge pin.\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly I found no DAddario Premium Grade bridge pin sets, even on foreign web sites or e-Bay. So maybe this\\\\nis an old product from bygone dayscurious. Also both DAddario and Planet Waves black bridge pins carry the exact\\\\nsame Item number.  It is possible there was some corporate reshuffling of product branding or some such thing.\\\\n\\\\nNow back to the review\\\\nfirst some comparative stats on the stock bridge pins and the new Planet Waves, uh, DAddario Ebony Bridge pin\\\\nset (whatever):\\\\n\\\\n--Existing Plastic Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length:  1-1/4 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  1 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n--Ebony Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length: 1 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  3/4 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n[End Pin: Total Length:  1-1/16 inch | Length below Head:  3/4inch | Width below Head:  1/4 inch\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see the new replacement Ebony bridge pins are  inch shorter but the same width below the head. The\\\\npins fit just right but, at first, I had a bit of difficulty getting the string ball-end to catch the pin; most likely due to the\\\\nshorter length. Once I learned how to catch the ball-end so it rested against the pin, and not below it, the rest of the\\\\npins installed without a problem. I have never owned bridge pins this short before.\\\\n\\\\nI did have some ride-up of the low-E pin initially when tuning the string to pitch. I just needed to make sure the ball\\\\nend of the string was pulled up as far as it could go. Once that was achieved the pin seated correctly into the saddle\\\\nholes.\\\\n\\\\nSound wise I didn\\'t find too much of an up-tick in tone. I am using DR Sunbeams Lights (12-54) Phosphor Bronze\\\\nround core strings and they seemed to brighten up the high end a bit but the mids and bass sound the same; there\\\\nwas no AHA-WOW-that-is-a-huge-difference kind of reaction. Obviously your mileage may vary dependent upon the\\\\nstrings you use, size of guitar, how its braced and on and on.\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to appearancewhat can I saytheyre blackjust like the plastic ones replaced. No enhancement of\\\\nappearance with the plain black ones but that is what I wanted and expected. Yet, for some strange reason I have\\\\nbecome an incredible guitar player because of the new pin set.

So if your seedlings are strong, it will overcome and outcompete everything else and thrive. If it hesitates, then there\\'s a good chance the fungus/bacterial will overtake the seeds.

So I ordered\\\\nthe Planet Waves Ebony Bridge Pin set with End Pin. What arrived was a totally different package than expected\\\\nand with one less bridge pin. Nice box though.\\\\n\\\\nThe reason I am not too concerned about it, or complained about it, is that I only paid $11.00, shipped, for the set. The\\\\nlowest cost I could find on the net, including Amazon, is $16.00 for the Planet Waves 7 pin plus End pin set encased\\\\nin a typical plastic blister pack. I received a pretty good deal in the end. I can go without an extra bridge pin.\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly I found no DAddario Premium Grade bridge pin sets, even on foreign web sites or e-Bay. So maybe this\\\\nis an old product from bygone dayscurious. Also both DAddario and Planet Waves black bridge pins carry the exact\\\\nsame Item number.  It is possible there was some corporate reshuffling of product branding or some such thing.\\\\n\\\\nNow back to the review\\\\nfirst some comparative stats on the stock bridge pins and the new Planet Waves, uh, DAddario Ebony Bridge pin\\\\nset (whatever):\\\\n\\\\n--Existing Plastic Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length:  1-1/4 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  1 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n--Ebony Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length: 1 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  3/4 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n[End Pin: Total Length:  1-1/16 inch | Length below Head:  3/4inch | Width below Head:  1/4 inch\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see the new replacement Ebony bridge pins are  inch shorter but the same width below the head. The\\\\npins fit just right but, at first, I had a bit of difficulty getting the string ball-end to catch the pin; most likely due to the\\\\nshorter length. Once I learned how to catch the ball-end so it rested against the pin, and not below it, the rest of the\\\\npins installed without a problem. I have never owned bridge pins this short before.\\\\n\\\\nI did have some ride-up of the low-E pin initially when tuning the string to pitch. I just needed to make sure the ball\\\\nend of the string was pulled up as far as it could go. Once that was achieved the pin seated correctly into the saddle\\\\nholes.\\\\n\\\\nSound wise I didn\\'t find too much of an up-tick in tone. I am using DR Sunbeams Lights (12-54) Phosphor Bronze\\\\nround core strings and they seemed to brighten up the high end a bit but the mids and bass sound the same; there\\\\nwas no AHA-WOW-that-is-a-huge-difference kind of reaction. Obviously your mileage may vary dependent upon the\\\\nstrings you use, size of guitar, how its braced and on and on.\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to appearancewhat can I saytheyre blackjust like the plastic ones replaced. No enhancement of\\\\nappearance with the plain black ones but that is what I wanted and expected. Yet, for some strange reason I have\\\\nbecome an incredible guitar player because of the new pin set. What a transformation.  ;-) Okay maybe not\\\\n\\\\nso, if you are expecting the extra pin you might be disappointed, you may not be. You might get the DAddario version\\\\nand not the Planet Waves version. Just a heads up on this, thats all. The bridge pins from both packages appear to\\\\nbe exactly the same product just different packaging.\\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind the product I received gets 5 stars for working well with very little hassle.  I would buy them again for\\\\nsure, probably not for the same price though. Seems like it was fluke.

So I ordered\\\\nthe Planet Waves Ebony Bridge Pin set with End Pin. What arrived was a totally different package than expected\\\\nand with one less bridge pin. Nice box though.\\\\n\\\\nThe reason I am not too concerned about it, or complained about it, is that I only paid $11.00, shipped, for the set. The\\\\nlowest cost I could find on the net, including Amazon, is $16.00 for the Planet Waves 7 pin plus End pin set encased\\\\nin a typical plastic blister pack. I received a pretty good deal in the end. I can go without an extra bridge pin.\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly I found no DAddario Premium Grade bridge pin sets, even on foreign web sites or e-Bay. So maybe this\\\\nis an old product from bygone dayscurious. Also both DAddario and Planet Waves black bridge pins carry the exact\\\\nsame Item number.  It is possible there was some corporate reshuffling of product branding or some such thing.\\\\n\\\\nNow back to the review\\\\nfirst some comparative stats on the stock bridge pins and the new Planet Waves, uh, DAddario Ebony Bridge pin\\\\nset (whatever):\\\\n\\\\n--Existing Plastic Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length:  1-1/4 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  1 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n--Ebony Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length: 1 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  3/4 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n[End Pin: Total Length:  1-1/16 inch | Length below Head:  3/4inch | Width below Head:  1/4 inch\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see the new replacement Ebony bridge pins are  inch shorter but the same width below the head. The\\\\npins fit just right but, at first, I had a bit of difficulty getting the string ball-end to catch the pin; most likely due to the\\\\nshorter length. Once I learned how to catch the ball-end so it rested against the pin, and not below it, the rest of the\\\\npins installed without a problem. I have never owned bridge pins this short before.\\\\n\\\\nI did have some ride-up of the low-E pin initially when tuning the string to pitch. I just needed to make sure the ball\\\\nend of the string was pulled up as far as it could go. Once that was achieved the pin seated correctly into the saddle\\\\nholes.\\\\n\\\\nSound wise I didn\\'t find too much of an up-tick in tone. I am using DR Sunbeams Lights (12-54) Phosphor Bronze\\\\nround core strings and they seemed to brighten up the high end a bit but the mids and bass sound the same; there\\\\nwas no AHA-WOW-that-is-a-huge-difference kind of reaction. Obviously your mileage may vary dependent upon the\\\\nstrings you use, size of guitar, how its braced and on and on.\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to appearancewhat can I saytheyre blackjust like the plastic ones replaced. No enhancement of\\\\nappearance with the plain black ones but that is what I wanted and expected. Yet, for some strange reason I have\\\\nbecome an incredible guitar player because of the new pin set. What a transformation.  ;-) Okay maybe not\\\\n\\\\nso, if you are expecting the extra pin you might be disappointed, you may not be. You might get the DAddario version\\\\nand not the Planet Waves version. Just a heads up on this, thats all. The bridge pins from both packages appear to\\\\nbe exactly the same product just different packaging.\\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind the product I received gets 5 stars for working well with very little hassle.  I would buy them again for\\\\nsure, probably not for the same price though. Seems like it was fluke.

      " [b'{\"asin\":\"B0002GIRM0\",\"overall\":\"5.0\",\"reviewText\":\"There are better boxes out there, but they come with that tradition \\\\\"better price\\\\\" which could easily push you over $1000.  This is Radial\\'s top of the line stage class passive DI.  It\\'s the JDI (Jenson Direct box) Duplex (for stereo applications.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is it?\\\\nIf your not familiar with DI\\'s (aka Direct Boxes) they are a device that electricaly isolates an unbalanced line level input and transforms it to a balanced line level output.  It does this thru a transformer and (without getting into the physics) as such protects both lines from one another while at the same time elemintaing the possibility for problematic ground loops.  Also it protects equipment from mismatched levels and signals that could damage with the device or the mic preamp.\\\\n\\\\nWhy do you need one?\\\\nIf you were to just \\\\\"plug\\\\\" an instrument such as a guitar (which uses unbalanced line level) into a mic line (which is a balanced AND in many cases POWERED line) the best thing that can happen is you\\'ll get signal dropout, noise, hum, distorsion, ect.  The worst that could happen is a potentially powered line could cook your output on your instrument.  This often the case where people plug iPods or laptops into powered stage mixers or PA lines.  The small voltage of a small electronic device becomes overwhelmed and shorts out due to the MUCH higher voltage and current of the PA\\'s Phantom Powered lines.  Even if the PA your wiring into is a traditional PA (lacking powered mic lines) with a pre-amp to boost the passive signals there\\'s actually a risk to the PA with unbalanced sources.  The DI converts the signal to be safely compatible and protects all equipment from the issues at either end.  Also transforming a signal to a \\\\\"balanced line level\\\\\" creates a stable signal that can be sent long distances and can be easily boosted at the end while at the same time removing line noise caused by cabling acting as an antenna.\\\\n\\\\nThis box is part of Radial\\'s JDI line that uses genuine Jensen transformers for soft and subtle sound curves.  Radial makes more affordable models that also sound terrific.  However I wanted an \\\\\"Any Situation\\\\\" type box.  This box is a stereo box which fits that bill nicely.  It is acutally two seperate mono JDI\\'s, each with their own transformer, in a single case.  You could run two individual mono inputs and outputs if you wanted.  But by pluging the individual right and left channels of a stereo device into each half of this box then running two output lines to the PA you preserve the stereo signal.\\\\n\\\\nI/O\\\\nOn the rear of the box each channel has a 1/4\\\\\" input jack and a 1/4\\\\\" thruput jack (for running a thru line to stage monitors).  There\\'s a \\\\\"mix button\\\\\" that will allow the thruput line to become a second input line for mixing stereo signals to mono.  Each channel also two RCA inputs for mixing auido out of digital devices line CD/DVD, ipod, laptop, ect.  The pairs for each channel are mixed to mono at output.  Being a stereo box you might wonder why you would mix back to mono.  Perhaps you only wish to run one line back to to PA mixer.  The front of the unit has one XLR output and one XLR input for each channel.  So as I said this can work as two standalone mono boxes.  What if you want stereo?  One the L channel to an input on channel 1 (1/4\\\\\" in or RCA doesn\\'t matter) then R channel to channel 2.  Then run two XLR outputs to your PA mixer or console.\\\\n\\\\nOther nice features\\\\nThis unit features all metal construction which creates an electromanetic cage to shield it from outside interference.  NICE if you standing next to HUGE stage moniters driving enormous magnets with tons of power.  Each cannel has a high pass filter switch and a pad switch for devices.  The pad is nice for digital devices like CD, ipod, ect.  It also has a polarity flip switch for each output to eleminate hum caused by import sound devices.  And lastly a ground lift switch to further isolate ground loops.\\\\n\\\\nAs I said this unit is about as good as it gets for passiv DI\\'s.  There are such things as Active DIs but that\\'s a whole different animal.  For most users, a passive is going to be the best choice.  And as I said there are other models that aren\\'t quite so pricey.  I\\'ll recommend a few.  If your application like mine is primarily AV presentation then this box is actually a bit overkill.  But like I said I wanted that \\\\\"super utility\\\\\" aka swiss army knife ablity coupled with true stereo and mono options.  For just mono AV work I can recommend the Radial ProAV1.  That line also contains several inexpensive stage type boxes.  A step between this model and those I just mensioned is the Radial JDI.  (Again this is the JDI duplex)  It\\'s the same technology and construction but at th same time is a mono box.  It still has the stereo to mono mix feature as well.  All will suit you well and sound great on systems big and small.\",\"reviewerID\":\"A3GT2EWQSO45ZG\",\"reviewerName\":\"DeusEx\",\"summary\":\"Best Passive DI you can get!\",\"verified\":\"true\",\"vote\":\"13\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140016979}']\n",

      " [b'{\"asin\":\"B0002GIRM0\",\"overall\":\"5.0\",\"reviewText\":\"There are better boxes out there, but they come with that tradition \\\\\"better price\\\\\" which could easily push you over $1000.  This is Radial\\'s top of the line stage class passive DI.  It\\'s the JDI (Jenson Direct box) Duplex (for stereo applications.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is it?\\\\nIf your not familiar with DI\\'s (aka Direct Boxes) they are a device that electricaly isolates an unbalanced line level input and transforms it to a balanced line level output.  It does this thru a transformer and (without getting into the physics) as such protects both lines from one another while at the same time elemintaing the possibility for problematic ground loops.  Also it protects equipment from mismatched levels and signals that could damage with the device or the mic preamp.\\\\n\\\\nWhy do you need one?\\\\nIf you were to just \\\\\"plug\\\\\" an instrument such as a guitar (which uses unbalanced line level) into a mic line (which is a balanced AND in many cases POWERED line) the best thing that can happen is you\\'ll get signal dropout, noise, hum, distorsion, ect.  The worst that could happen is a potentially powered line could cook your output on your instrument.  This often the case where people plug iPods or laptops into powered stage mixers or PA lines.  The small voltage of a small electronic device becomes overwhelmed and shorts out due to the MUCH higher voltage and current of the PA\\'s Phantom Powered lines.  Even if the PA your wiring into is a traditional PA (lacking powered mic lines) with a pre-amp to boost the passive signals there\\'s actually a risk to the PA with unbalanced sources.  The DI converts the signal to be safely compatible and protects all equipment from the issues at either end.  Also transforming a signal to a \\\\\"balanced line level\\\\\" creates a stable signal that can be sent long distances and can be easily boosted at the end while at the same time removing line noise caused by cabling acting as an antenna.\\\\n\\\\nThis box is part of Radial\\'s JDI line that uses genuine Jensen transformers for soft and subtle sound curves.  Radial makes more affordable models that also sound terrific.  However I wanted an \\\\\"Any Situation\\\\\" type box.  This box is a stereo box which fits that bill nicely.  It is acutally two seperate mono JDI\\'s, each with their own transformer, in a single case.  You could run two individual mono inputs and outputs if you wanted.  But by pluging the individual right and left channels of a stereo device into each half of this box then running two output lines to the PA you preserve the stereo signal.\\\\n\\\\nI/O\\\\nOn the rear of the box each channel has a 1/4\\\\\" input jack and a 1/4\\\\\" thruput jack (for running a thru line to stage monitors).  There\\'s a \\\\\"mix button\\\\\" that will allow the thruput line to become a second input line for mixing stereo signals to mono.  Each channel also two RCA inputs for mixing auido out of digital devices line CD/DVD, ipod, laptop, ect.  The pairs for each channel are mixed to mono at output.  Being a stereo box you might wonder why you would mix back to mono.  Perhaps you only wish to run one line back to to PA mixer.  The front of the unit has one XLR output and one XLR input for each channel.  So as I said this can work as two standalone mono boxes.  What if you want stereo?  One the L channel to an input on channel 1 (1/4\\\\\" in or RCA doesn\\'t matter) then R channel to channel 2.  Then run two XLR outputs to your PA mixer or console.\\\\n\\\\nOther nice features\\\\nThis unit features all metal construction which creates an electromanetic cage to shield it from outside interference.  NICE if you standing next to HUGE stage moniters driving enormous magnets with tons of power.  Each cannel has a high pass filter switch and a pad switch for devices.  The pad is nice for digital devices like CD, ipod, ect.  It also has a polarity flip switch for each output to eleminate hum caused by import sound devices.  And lastly a ground lift switch to further isolate ground loops.\\\\n\\\\nAs I said this unit is about as good as it gets for passiv DI\\'s.  There are such things as Active DIs but that\\'s a whole different animal.  For most users, a passive is going to be the best choice.  And as I said there are other models that aren\\'t quite so pricey.  I\\'ll recommend a few.  If your application like mine is primarily AV presentation then this box is actually a bit overkill.  But like I said I wanted that \\\\\"super utility\\\\\" aka swiss army knife ablity coupled with true stereo and mono options.  For just mono AV work I can recommend the Radial ProAV1.  That line also contains several inexpensive stage type boxes.  A step between this model and those I just mensioned is the Radial JDI.  (Again this is the JDI duplex)  It\\'s the same technology and construction but at th same time is a mono box.  It still has the stereo to mono mix feature as well.  All will suit you well and sound great on systems big and small.\",\"reviewerID\":\"A3GT2EWQSO45ZG\",\"reviewerName\":\"DeusEx\",\"summary\":\"Best Passive DI you can get!\",\"verified\":\"true\",\"vote\":\"13\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140016979}']\n",

So I ordered\\\\nthe Planet Waves Ebony Bridge Pin set with End Pin. What arrived was a totally different package than expected\\\\nand with one less bridge pin. Nice box though.\\\\n\\\\nThe reason I am not too concerned about it, or complained about it, is that I only paid $11.00, shipped, for the set. The\\\\nlowest cost I could find on the net, including Amazon, is $16.00 for the Planet Waves 7 pin plus End pin set encased\\\\nin a typical plastic blister pack. I received a pretty good deal in the end. I can go without an extra bridge pin.\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly I found no DAddario Premium Grade bridge pin sets, even on foreign web sites or e-Bay. So maybe this\\\\nis an old product from bygone dayscurious. Also both DAddario and Planet Waves black bridge pins carry the exact\\\\nsame Item number.  It is possible there was some corporate reshuffling of product branding or some such thing.\\\\n\\\\nNow back to the review\\\\nfirst some comparative stats on the stock bridge pins and the new Planet Waves, uh, DAddario Ebony Bridge pin\\\\nset (whatever):\\\\n\\\\n--Existing Plastic Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length:  1-1/4 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  1 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n--Ebony Bridge Pin Stats ---\\\\n> Total Length: 1 inch\\\\n> Length below Head:  3/4 inch\\\\n> Width below Head:  3/16 inch tapering down to 1/8 inch\\\\n\\\\n[End Pin: Total Length:  1-1/16 inch | Length below Head:  3/4inch | Width below Head:  1/4 inch\\\\n\\\\nAs you can see the new replacement Ebony bridge pins are  inch shorter but the same width below the head. The\\\\npins fit just right but, at first, I had a bit of difficulty getting the string ball-end to catch the pin; most likely due to the\\\\nshorter length. Once I learned how to catch the ball-end so it rested against the pin, and not below it, the rest of the\\\\npins installed without a problem. I have never owned bridge pins this short before.\\\\n\\\\nI did have some ride-up of the low-E pin initially when tuning the string to pitch. I just needed to make sure the ball\\\\nend of the string was pulled up as far as it could go. Once that was achieved the pin seated correctly into the saddle\\\\nholes.\\\\n\\\\nSound wise I didn\\'t find too much of an up-tick in tone. I am using DR Sunbeams Lights (12-54) Phosphor Bronze\\\\nround core strings and they seemed to brighten up the high end a bit but the mids and bass sound the same; there\\\\nwas no AHA-WOW-that-is-a-huge-difference kind of reaction. Obviously your mileage may vary dependent upon the\\\\nstrings you use, size of guitar, how its braced and on and on.\\\\n\\\\nWith regard to appearancewhat can I saytheyre blackjust like the plastic ones replaced. No enhancement of\\\\nappearance with the plain black ones but that is what I wanted and expected. Yet, for some strange reason I have\\\\nbecome an incredible guitar player because of the new pin set. What a transformation.  ;-) Okay maybe not\\\\n\\\\nso, if you are expecting the extra pin you might be disappointed, you may not be. You might get the DAddario version\\\\nand not the Planet Waves version. Just a heads up on this, thats all. The bridge pins from both packages appear to\\\\nbe exactly the same product just different packaging.\\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind the product I received gets 5 stars for working well with very little hassle.  I would buy them again for\\\\nsure, probably not for the same price though. Seems like it was fluke.

      " [b'{\"asin\":\"B0002GIRM0\",\"overall\":\"5.0\",\"reviewText\":\"There are better boxes out there, but they come with that tradition \\\\\"better price\\\\\" which could easily push you over $1000.  This is Radial\\'s top of the line stage class passive DI.  It\\'s the JDI (Jenson Direct box) Duplex (for stereo applications.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is it?\\\\nIf your not familiar with DI\\'s (aka Direct Boxes) they are a device that electricaly isolates an unbalanced line level input and transforms it to a balanced line level output.  It does this thru a transformer and (without getting into the physics) as such protects both lines from one another while at the same time elemintaing the possibility for problematic ground loops.  Also it protects equipment from mismatched levels and signals that could damage with the device or the mic preamp.\\\\n\\\\nWhy do you need one?\\\\nIf you were to just \\\\\"plug\\\\\" an instrument such as a guitar (which uses unbalanced line level) into a mic line (which is a balanced AND in many cases POWERED line) the best thing that can happen is you\\'ll get signal dropout, noise, hum, distorsion, ect.  The worst that could happen is a potentially powered line could cook your output on your instrument.  This often the case where people plug iPods or laptops into powered stage mixers or PA lines.  The small voltage of a small electronic device becomes overwhelmed and shorts out due to the MUCH higher voltage and current of the PA\\'s Phantom Powered lines.  Even if the PA your wiring into is a traditional PA (lacking powered mic lines) with a pre-amp to boost the passive signals there\\'s actually a risk to the PA with unbalanced sources.  The DI converts the signal to be safely compatible and protects all equipment from the issues at either end.  Also transforming a signal to a \\\\\"balanced line level\\\\\" creates a stable signal that can be sent long distances and can be easily boosted at the end while at the same time removing line noise caused by cabling acting as an antenna.\\\\n\\\\nThis box is part of Radial\\'s JDI line that uses genuine Jensen transformers for soft and subtle sound curves.  Radial makes more affordable models that also sound terrific.  However I wanted an \\\\\"Any Situation\\\\\" type box.  This box is a stereo box which fits that bill nicely.  It is acutally two seperate mono JDI\\'s, each with their own transformer, in a single case.  You could run two individual mono inputs and outputs if you wanted.  But by pluging the individual right and left channels of a stereo device into each half of this box then running two output lines to the PA you preserve the stereo signal.\\\\n\\\\nI/O\\\\nOn the rear of the box each channel has a 1/4\\\\\" input jack and a 1/4\\\\\" thruput jack (for running a thru line to stage monitors).  There\\'s a \\\\\"mix button\\\\\" that will allow the thruput line to become a second input line for mixing stereo signals to mono.  Each channel also two RCA inputs for mixing auido out of digital devices line CD/DVD, ipod, laptop, ect.  The pairs for each channel are mixed to mono at output.  Being a stereo box you might wonder why you would mix back to mono.  Perhaps you only wish to run one line back to to PA mixer.  The front of the unit has one XLR output and one XLR input for each channel.  So as I said this can work as two standalone mono boxes.  What if you want stereo?  One the L channel to an input on channel 1 (1/4\\\\\" in or RCA doesn\\'t matter) then R channel to channel 2.  Then run two XLR outputs to your PA mixer or console.\\\\n\\\\nOther nice features\\\\nThis unit features all metal construction which creates an electromanetic cage to shield it from outside interference.  NICE if you standing next to HUGE stage moniters driving enormous magnets with tons of power.  Each cannel has a high pass filter switch and a pad switch for devices.  The pad is nice for digital devices like CD, ipod, ect.  It also has a polarity flip switch for each output to eleminate hum caused by import sound devices.  And lastly a ground lift switch to further isolate ground loops.\\\\n\\\\nAs I said this unit is about as good as it gets for passiv DI\\'s.  There are such things as Active DIs but that\\'s a whole different animal.  For most users, a passive is going to be the best choice.  And as I said there are other models that aren\\'t quite so pricey.  I\\'ll recommend a few.  If your application like mine is primarily AV presentation then this box is actually a bit overkill.  But like I said I wanted that \\\\\"super utility\\\\\" aka swiss army knife ablity coupled with true stereo and mono options.  For just mono AV work I can recommend the Radial ProAV1.  That line also contains several inexpensive stage type boxes.  A step between this model and those I just mensioned is the Radial JDI.  (Again this is the JDI duplex)  It\\'s the same technology and construction but at th same time is a mono box.  It still has the stereo to mono mix feature as well.  All will suit you well and sound great on systems big and small.\",\"reviewerID\":\"A3GT2EWQSO45ZG\",\"reviewerName\":\"DeusEx\",\"summary\":\"Best Passive DI you can get!\",\"verified\":\"true\",\"vote\":\"13\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140016979}']\n",

This is Radial\\'s top of the line stage class passive DI.  It\\'s the JDI (Jenson Direct box) Duplex (for stereo applications.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is it?\\\\nIf your not familiar with DI\\'s (aka Direct Boxes) they are a device that electricaly isolates an unbalanced line level input and transforms it to a balanced line level output.  It does this thru a transformer and (without getting into the physics) as such protects both lines from one another while at the same time elemintaing the possibility for problematic ground loops.  Also it protects equipment from mismatched levels and signals that could damage with the device or the mic preamp.\\\\n\\\\nWhy do you need one?\\\\nIf you were to just \\\\\"plug\\\\\" an instrument such as a guitar (which uses unbalanced line level) into a mic line (which is a balanced AND in many cases POWERED line) the best thing that can happen is you\\'ll get signal dropout, noise, hum, distorsion, ect.  The worst that could happen is a potentially powered line could cook your output on your instrument.  This often the case where people plug iPods or laptops into powered stage mixers or PA lines.  The small voltage of a small electronic device becomes overwhelmed and shorts out due to the MUCH higher voltage and current of the PA\\'s Phantom Powered lines.  Even if the PA your wiring into is a traditional PA (lacking powered mic lines) with a pre-amp to boost the passive signals there\\'s actually a risk to the PA with unbalanced sources.  The DI converts the signal to be safely compatible and protects all equipment from the issues at either end.  Also transforming a signal to a \\\\\"balanced line level\\\\\" creates a stable signal that can be sent long distances and can be easily boosted at the end while at the same time removing line noise caused by cabling acting as an antenna.\\\\n\\\\nThis box is part of Radial\\'s JDI line that uses genuine Jensen transformers for soft and subtle sound curves.  Radial makes more affordable models that also sound terrific.  However I wanted an \\\\\"Any Situation\\\\\" type box.  This box is a stereo box which fits that bill nicely.  It is acutally two seperate mono JDI\\'s, each with their own transformer, in a single case.  You could run two individual mono inputs and outputs if you wanted.  But by pluging the individual right and left channels of a stereo device into each half of this box then running two output lines to the PA you preserve the stereo signal.\\\\n\\\\nI/O\\\\nOn the rear of the box each channel has a 1/4\\\\\" input jack and a 1/4\\\\\" thruput jack (for running a thru line to stage monitors).  There\\'s a \\\\\"mix button\\\\\" that will allow the thruput line to become a second input line for mixing stereo signals to mono.  Each channel also two RCA inputs for mixing auido out of digital devices line CD/DVD, ipod, laptop, ect.  The pairs for each channel are mixed to mono at output.  Being a stereo box you might wonder why you would mix back to mono.  Perhaps you only wish to run one line back to to PA mixer.  The front of the unit has one XLR output and one XLR input for each channel.  So as I said this can work as two standalone mono boxes.  What if you want stereo?  One the L channel to an input on channel 1 (1/4\\\\\" in or RCA doesn\\'t matter) then R channel to channel 2.  Then run two XLR outputs to your PA mixer or console.\\\\n\\\\nOther nice features\\\\nThis unit features all metal construction which creates an electromanetic cage to shield it from outside interference.  NICE if you standing next to HUGE stage moniters driving enormous magnets with tons of power.  Each cannel has a high pass filter switch and a pad switch for devices.  The pad is nice for digital devices like CD, ipod, ect.  It also has a polarity flip switch for each output to eleminate hum caused by import sound devices.  And lastly a ground lift switch to further isolate ground loops.\\\\n\\\\nAs I said this unit is about as good as it gets for passiv DI\\'s.  There are such things as Active DIs but that\\'s a whole different animal.  For most users, a passive is going to be the best choice.  And as I said there are other models that aren\\'t quite so pricey.  I\\'ll recommend a few.  If your application like mine is primarily AV presentation then this box is actually a bit overkill.  But like I said I wanted that \\\\\"super utility\\\\\" aka swiss army knife ablity coupled with true stereo and mono options.  For just mono AV work I can recommend the Radial ProAV1.  That line also contains several inexpensive stage type boxes.  A step between this model and those I just mensioned is the Radial JDI.  (Again this is the JDI duplex)  It\\'s the same technology and construction but at th same time is a mono box.  It still has the stereo to mono mix feature as well.  All will suit you well and sound great on systems big and small.\",\"reviewerID\":\"A3GT2EWQSO45ZG\",\"reviewerName\":\"DeusEx\",\"summary\":\"Best Passive DI you can get!\",\"verified\":\"true\",\"vote\":\"13\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140016979}']\n",

I put this head on a steel snare (not a particularly nice one, practice kit) in my studio, replacing the old batter head which was an Evans G1. The G1 was really bright and I wanted something with a little more thud, a little darker and good with brushes for my alt.country band. The Emperor X works great for that sound.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, it did take a while for me to dial in something I like, and everyone has to season to taste, but once I found the sweet spot I really like the way this head performs. It definitely likes to be hit hard, but even when you do lay into it there is a nice focused tone, as others have pointed out. I prefer, especially when recording, to have a bit less ring to the snare, and this gets all the fatness without the whine of the steel snare shell. It takes muffling well too, and retains its tone even with a tea towel draped over it for extreme dampening. Also, it\\'s super thick and should stand up to a serious beating for a long time.\\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint is that it does want to be hit just below dead center (at least on my snare) to get the best tone, and as you move out from there the pitch and sustain change a bit more noticeably than I\\'d like. But then, a good drummer (not me) can control that sort of thing.

I put this head on a steel snare (not a particularly nice one, practice kit) in my studio, replacing the old batter head which was an Evans G1. The G1 was really bright and I wanted something with a little more thud, a little darker and good with brushes for my alt.country band. The Emperor X works great for that sound.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, it did take a while for me to dial in something I like, and everyone has to season to taste, but once I found the sweet spot I really like the way this head performs. It definitely likes to be hit hard, but even when you do lay into it there is a nice focused tone, as others have pointed out. I prefer, especially when recording, to have a bit less ring to the snare, and this gets all the fatness without the whine of the steel snare shell. It takes muffling well too, and retains its tone even with a tea towel draped over it for extreme dampening. Also, it\\'s super thick and should stand up to a serious beating for a long time.\\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint is that it does want to be hit just below dead center (at least on my snare) to get the best tone, and as you move out from there the pitch and sustain change a bit more noticeably than I\\'d like. But then, a good drummer (not me) can control that sort of thing.

If the first reviewer is correct, even 32x \\'music only\\' may be too fast. Try finding 24x anywhere but from hhb!  Also, TASCAM sez its 900 model works with 52x.

The RCAs make it easy to connect to a DJ system, and the coax/SPDIF jacks are good for home theater systems, although I do wish it had XLRs to more closely match pro audio systems like sound reinforcement. Of course, that\\'s why they make the BurnIT PLUS, but I didn\\'t feel like spending the extra money, it isn\\'t that hard to make things go together.\\\\n\\\\nQuality:\\\\n\\\\nThe fit and finish are impeccable, and the purple front panel is gorgeous. Controls and switches have a good feel. It uses a little too much plastic for pro audio, and the sheet metal used in the chassis and cabinet is noticeable thinner than I am accustomed to in Mackie, Peavey, Behringer, etc. I might call it consumer grade construction, but today\\'s consumer gear is REALLY built wimpy. Older consumer gear is closer, I would say that this machine is about at the level of DJ equipment construction-wise. I think it would be crazy to take this out on the road without rackmounting it or using a custom carrying case.

I put this head on a steel snare (not a particularly nice one, practice kit) in my studio, replacing the old batter head which was an Evans G1. The G1 was really bright and I wanted something with a little more thud, a little darker and good with brushes for my alt.country band. The Emperor X works great for that sound.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, it did take a while for me to dial in something I like, and everyone has to season to taste, but once I found the sweet spot I really like the way this head performs. It definitely likes to be hit hard, but even when you do lay into it there is a nice focused tone, as others have pointed out. I prefer, especially when recording, to have a bit less ring to the snare, and this gets all the fatness without the whine of the steel snare shell. It takes muffling well too, and retains its tone even with a tea towel draped over it for extreme dampening. Also, it\\'s super thick and should stand up to a serious beating for a long time.\\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint is that it does want to be hit just below dead center (at least on my snare) to get the best tone, and as you move out from there the pitch and sustain change a bit more noticeably than I\\'d like.

I put this head on a steel snare (not a particularly nice one, practice kit) in my studio, replacing the old batter head which was an Evans G1. The G1 was really bright and I wanted something with a little more thud, a little darker and good with brushes for my alt.country band. The Emperor X works great for that sound.\\\\n\\\\nTo be fair, it did take a while for me to dial in something I like, and everyone has to season to taste, but once I found the sweet spot I really like the way this head performs. It definitely likes to be hit hard, but even when you do lay into it there is a nice focused tone, as others have pointed out. I prefer, especially when recording, to have a bit less ring to the snare, and this gets all the fatness without the whine of the steel snare shell. It takes muffling well too, and retains its tone even with a tea towel draped over it for extreme dampening. Also, it\\'s super thick and should stand up to a serious beating for a long time.\\\\n\\\\nMy only complaint is that it does want to be hit just below dead center (at least on my snare) to get the best tone, and as you move out from there the pitch and sustain change a bit more noticeably than I\\'d like. But then, a good drummer (not me) can control that sort of thing.

I checked on the mechanisms and I think they look strong and reliable with a very smooth and fast response. When my kid started playing it, he had some trouble due to the the big square hole the D1 headjoint has, but it took him just an hour or so to feel completely comfortable with it. The flute\\'s tone is really warm and I thought it was more powerful than other similar flutes, that proved to be true later in the evening when we compared it with two Armstrongs and one Yamaha the orchestra has, which are way more expensive than the Jupiter. We\\'re very happy with this new instrument. The orchestras\\' director and the flute intructor (who has a college degree on flute) confirmed my first impressions.

I\\'ve had them sitting on a strat and les paul, both sound amazing, feel great, and haven\\'t shown much at all of rust, decay, oxidation etc etc, and either one is in case or sits on stand in room, and still sounds near fresh.  buy em, you will be happy, trust me I\\'ve played this long and gibson has done thank g-d a good job and liven up to their famous name for quality yet again.  the other gauges are also good, as well has vintage reiissue and ace frehley.  the brites are similar to frehley\\'s and cheaper.  the price is right!\",\"reviewerID\":\"AOWL4BHVA7WYK\",\"reviewerName\":\"jon\",\"summary\":\"very happy, and used many brands including the coated ones\",\"verified\":\"false\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140017173}']\n",

We recieved the flute yesterday, it\\'s just beautiful and looks very well made, with good balance and weight. I checked on the mechanisms and I think they look strong and reliable with a very smooth and fast response. When my kid started playing it, he had some trouble due to the the big square hole the D1 headjoint has, but it took him just an hour or so to feel completely comfortable with it. The flute\\'s tone is really warm and I thought it was more powerful than other similar flutes, that proved to be true later in the evening when we compared it with two Armstrongs and one Yamaha the orchestra has, which are way more expensive than the Jupiter. We\\'re very happy with this new instrument. The orchestras\\' director and the flute intructor (who has a college degree on flute) confirmed my first impressions. Now we know why a lot of professional teachers and players recomend the Jupiter 1011 flute for this level.\",\"reviewerID\":\"A1LISLP14OYQG\",\"reviewerName\":\"MARCOPH\",\"summary\":\"Best value\",\"verified\":\"true\",\"vote\":\"3\",\"internal_partition\":\"0\",\"partition_number\":140017175}']\n",
